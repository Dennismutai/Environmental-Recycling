        <h1>What do we do</h1>
        <p>We conserve the environment by Recycling, recovery, and reprocessing of waste materials to turn them into new products. 
           The simple phases in recycling are the series of waste materials, their processing or manufacture into new products, and the purchase of those products, which may be recycled.
           Typical substances that are recycled encompass iron and metal scrap, aluminum cans, glass bottles, paper, wood, and plastics.
